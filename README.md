# Diorama v2 - 27.03.2023

Almost 10 years ago I [wrote an algorithm](https://github.com/mendrik/diorama) that layouts a set of images into a fixed-size rectangle. The old algorithm was heavily optimized for speed making the code hard to read and even harder to maintain.

Recently (2023) I had an idea how to simplify the algortihm and decided to put this on to a more modern foundation.

The result [can be seen here](https://mendrik.github.io/diorama-2023/).

I will probably make this an installable React component in the near future.
